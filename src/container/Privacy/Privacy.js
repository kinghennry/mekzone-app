          Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services: We collect
          Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information,
          such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our
          surveys, register for access to the Services or use certain Services.
          Wherever Mekzone collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a
          link to this Privacy Policy.

        <span className="terms__details">
          By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to
          our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide

          Non-Identifiable Data: When you interact with Mekzone through the
          Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable
          information. Such information, which is collected passively using
          various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically
          identify you. Mekzone may store such information itself or such
          information may be included in databases owned and maintained by
          Mekzone affiliates, agents or service providers. The Services may use
          such information and pool it with other information to track, for
          example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of
          visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our
          visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no
          Personal Data is available or used in this process.
        </span>
        <span className="terms__details">
          In operating the Services, we may use a technology called "cookies." A
          cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our
          Services gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our
          cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help
          us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may
          set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Services
          without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once
          during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we
          will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most
          web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please
          refer to this section for information on how to receive notification
          when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We
          recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to
          take advantage of some of the Service features.

          Aggregated Personal Data: In an ongoing effort to better understand
          and serve the users of the Services, Mekzone often conducts research
          on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the
          Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may
          be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Mekzone may share
          this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners.
          This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Mekzone
          may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our
          services to current and prospective business partners, and to other
          third parties for other lawful purposes. Third Party Tracking and
          Analytics: We may allow third party service providers to use cookies
          or similar technologies to collect information about your browsing
          activities over time and across different websites following your use
          of the Services. For example, we may use Google Analytics, a web
          analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), and Mixpanel, a
          mobile and web analytics platform provided by Mixpanel, Inc.
          (“Mixpanel”). Google and Mixpanel use cookies or similar technologies
          to help us analyze how users function and use our mobile applications
          and the Site to improve our Service. We may also implement Google
          Analytics features based on Display Advertising (which may include
          Remarketing with Google Analytics). Visitors can opt out by using
          Google’s Ads Settings or going to

        non-identifiable information collected through the Services to help us
        improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better
        understand our users and to improve the Services. Mekzone and its

        you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so,
        each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions
        permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing
        communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any
        future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted
        from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below. If Mekzone
        intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent

        Mekzone is not in the business of selling your information. We consider
        this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There
        are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal
        Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set
        forth below: Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might
        sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale,
        merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may
        be part of the transferred assets. Related Companies: We may also share
        your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent
        with this Privacy Policy. Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:
        Mekzone, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to
        perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions
        include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing
        payments. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this
        nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to
        perform their specific function. Legal Requirements: Mekzone may
        disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good
        faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal
        obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Mekzone,
        (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of
        users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal
        liability.
